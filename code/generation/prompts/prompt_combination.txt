### Instruction:
Act as an expert in combining JSON data outputs generated by language models.

You will receive multiple JSON fragments related to literary metadata.

Your task is to combine all the following JSON fragments into a single coherent and well-structured JSON object that contains all the information without loss or duplication.

Please strictly follow these field limitations when combining the JSON:

{{
  "dct:description": "Summary of the novel content (max. 4-5 sentences).",
  "dcat:keyword": "A list of relevant keywords that describe central aspects of the text (max. 5 keywords).",
  "dcat:theme": "The main theme or literary categories that fit the novel content. If there is more than one main theme, write them in list form. Remember that dcat:theme is not the same as dct:type.",
  "dct:spatial": "Geographic location where the action takes place (if inferable). If there is more than one geographic location, write them in list form. Try to say the country, as far as possible.",
  "dct:temporal": "Historical time or period in which the action takes place (if inferable). If there is more than one historical time, write them in list form.",
  "dct:type": "Type of novel, selecting from the following list (also add the relevant English Wikipedia link): ['Sentimental novel' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentimental_novel, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_novel), 'Gothic or horror novel' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_fiction), 'Mystery novel' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction), 'Historic novel' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_fiction), 'Victorian realist or naturalist novel' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_literature, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose_fiction), 'Novel of manners' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel_of_manners), 'Adventure novel' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_fiction), 'Science fiction' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction), 'Social novel' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_novel), 'Erotic novel' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erotic_fiction)]. Do not add this link to the metadata; it is only for your additional information.",
  "mainCharacters": [
    {{
      "name": "Character name.",
      "profile": "Brief profile (2-3 sentences) describing traits, role, and relevance."
    }}
    // Include 3-4 main characters if possible.
  ]
}}

The output must be a single valid JSON block, without any additional explanations or text outside the JSON.

### Input JSON to combine:
{jsons_partial}

### Additional instructions:
- Preserve the structure of each field and correct any logical inconsistencies.
- Merge lists of similar elements (e.g., characters, keywords) into unique lists without duplicates.
- If there are conflicting values in fields, choose the most representative or relevant one.
- The output must be strictly well-formed JSON.
- Do not add any text outside the final JSON.
- Keep the language consistent with the metadata input. Remember to translate "dct:type" if necessary.

### Expected output (combined JSON):

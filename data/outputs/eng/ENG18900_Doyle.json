    "dct:description": "A young governess, Mary Morstan, seeks Sherlock Holmes's help after receiving mysterious annual pearls and a summons promising justice. Holmes and Watson investigate the disappearance of her father and the rediscovery of the Agra treasure, tracing clues to the Sholto family, a secret map, and a vendetta stretching back to the Andaman convict camps. The enquiry leads to a nocturnal break-in, a poisoned murder, a daring river chase, and the capture of the fugitives, including Jonathan Small and his Andaman companion Tonga. The resolution recovers an iron chest but finds the jewels gone, and the narrative examines guilt, revenge, and the colonial backstory that produced the crime.",

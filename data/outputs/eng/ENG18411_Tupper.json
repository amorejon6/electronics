    "dct:description": "Set chiefly in the small English watering-place of Burleigh-Singleton, The Twins recounts the moral and domestic conflicts of two very unlike twin brothers, Charles and Julian Tracy, who both fall in love with their father's ward, Emily Warren. Jealousy, vice, and secrecy drive Julian to attempt fratricide and later suicide, while Charles survives, voyages to India to clear up Emily's obscure origins, and returns with proof that she is Amy Stuart. The narrative exposes themes of parental neglect, colonial entanglements, and the redemptive power of love and religion, culminating in reconciliation and a lawful marriage. The story mixes melodrama, social critique, and sentimental domesticity to teach moral lessons about duty, secresy, and the consequences of sin.",

    "dct:description": "A young, ambitious woman, Bernardine Holme, goes to the Alpine spa Petershof to recover from a breakdown and encounters a community of invalids and their caretakers. There she forms an uneasy but transforming friendship with the taciturn Robert Allitsen, the so-called \"Disagreeable Man,\" and through daily life, small acts of kindness and moments of remorse the characters confront suffering, duty and tenderness. The novel traces moral awakening, quiet heroism and misplaced priorities among guests such as the frivolous Mrs. Reffold and her dying husband, culminating in Bernardine's tragic accident and death and Allitsen's resolution to live differently. Overall it is a study of illness, compassion, sacrifice and the slow work of human understanding.",

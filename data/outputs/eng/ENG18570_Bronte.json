    "dct:description": "An Englishman, William Crimsworth, forsakes patronage and genteel expectations to work in his brother’s northern manufacturing business, where he suffers harsh treatment and is eventually dismissed. He emigrates to Belgium, becomes a teacher, and builds an independent life through industry and integrity. He befriends and eventually marries Frances Evans Henri, an Anglo‑Swiss former lace‑mender whom he trains and who becomes his professional and domestic partner. The novel examines class conflict, the moral effects of industrial capitalism, the realities of teaching and female education, and personal perseverance in the Victorian era.",

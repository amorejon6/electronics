    "dct:description": "A comic diary of Charles Pooter, a self-important but affectionate middle-class clerk who records the trivial trials and small triumphs of domestic life in suburban London. Episodes recount his efforts to maintain respectability — dealing with tradesmen, neighbours, clubable friends, and his social ambitions — while family tensions arise around his son Lupin's romantic and financial escapades. The narrative satirises Victorian suburban manners and petty pretensions through gentle, observational humour. It culminates in Pooter's promotion at work and an unexpectedly generous reward from his employer, alongside continuing domestic anxieties about Lupin's conduct.",

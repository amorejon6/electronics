    "dct:description": "Set in 1719 and early 18th-century Europe, the narrative follows Charles Wogan, an Irish officer, who undertakes a daring solitary enterprise to rescue Princess Clementina Sobieski from custody at Innspruck and escort her to safety in Italy. The plot interweaves high-stakes escapes, pitched fights, secret passages, and an international web of political intrigue around dynastic marriage for the Jacobite claimant, the Chevalier de St. George. Personal passions complicate the mission: Wogan's silent devotion to Clementina, the Chevalier's divided loyalties and Maria Vittoria de Caprara's involvement produce jealousies, betrayals, and difficult moral choices. The rescue succeeds and a proxy marriage is arranged, but love, duty and political necessity leave lasting sacrifice and exile for the principal actors.",

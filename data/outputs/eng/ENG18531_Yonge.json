    "dct:description": "After the death of the old baronet the young heir Sir Guy Morville comes under the care of the Edmonstone family at Hollywell, where his high spirits, proud family legacy and impulsive temper create both warmth and domestic strain. Rumours of gambling and a guardian's wounded pride provoke a rupture driven by Philip Morville's jealous suspicion, precipitating misunderstandings, a banishment, and acts of devotion including a dramatic rescue at sea. The narrative traces engagement, marriage and later calamity — Guy's later illness and death abroad — and follows Amy's patient widowhood, Philip's grave illness, confession and moral repentance. Through grief, confession and forgiveness the household seeks social restoration, inheritance resolution and moral consolation amid Victorian domestic expectations.",

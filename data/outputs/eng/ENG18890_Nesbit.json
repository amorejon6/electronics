    "dct:description": "A politically charged novel following Russian exile Count Michael Litvinoff and his circle in England, mixing revolutionary agitation with intimate English country life. Litvinoff's pamphlet and speeches inflame passions; his association with the Ferrier family embroils two brothers in rivalry over Clare Stanley and in a closing of Thornsett Mill that triggers labour unrest. Parallel threads follow Alice Hatfield's fall, rescue and marriage, and the fate of several men crushed by class conflict, culminating in violence, tragedy and personal sacrifice. The book examines the costs of political commitment, personal conscience, and the collision of private love with public causes.",

    "dct:description": "A portrait of the Hon. Bertie Cecil, a dashing Household Guardsman whose sporting fame and easy charm mask desperate debts and a reckless life; his celebrated steeple-chaser Forest King is mysteriously doctored at Baden and a forged bill ruins his reputation, forcing him to flee. Assuming the name Louis Victor and serving as a Chasseur d'Afrique in French Algeria, he endures exile and frontier warfare while protecting family secrets and sustaining quiet heroism. The vivandière Cigarette, a fiery camp heroine, falls for him and ultimately sacrifices her life to save him amid raids, desert diplomacy and pitched skirmishes under officers such as Colonel Châteauroy. Set across England, continental Europe and colonial Algeria, the narrative examines honour, military brotherhood, social manners, romantic jealousy and the costs of fashionable life and exile.",

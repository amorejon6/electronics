    "dct:description": "The novel traces intersecting domestic and political dramas in mid‑Victorian England, centring on Alice Vavasor's moral struggle between duty, past passion and a pragmatic engagement. Parallel plots follow George Vavasor's ambitious and ruinous pursuit of parliamentary office, Lady Glencora Palliser's flirtation and its threat to her marriage, and the workings of aristocratic society and electioneering. Scenes move between drawing‑rooms, provincial estates and Continental resorts, exposing hypocrisy, financial scheming, and the costs of private passions. The narrative concludes in moral reckonings—ruin, repentance, reconciliation and domestic settlement—against the backdrop of public life and social reputation.",

She struggles between duty, remorse and desire, at times funding George's ambitions and later repenting, ultimately reconciling with and marrying John Grey.

He loves Alice devotedly, tolerates her doubts, confronts social and violent threats (including George's pistol incident) and later enters public life as a Member of Parliament.

After electoral failure and exposure he descends into despair, threatens violence, fires at John Grey and flees abroad, representing the destructive edge of pride and social ambition. George's trajectory illustrates the costs of personal ambition and social collapse."

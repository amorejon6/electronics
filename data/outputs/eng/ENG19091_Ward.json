    "dct:description": "Daphne, or \"Marriage à la Mode\" follows the marriage and rupture between Daphne Floyd, an independently wealthy American woman, and Roger Barnes, an attractive but struggling Englishman, tracing the social, moral, and legal consequences of divorce across England and the United States. The novel dramatizes jealousy, pride, and contrasting national attitudes toward marriage and divorce as Daphne reclaims her freedom and Roger is driven into illness and degradation. Friends and critics — notably Madeleine Verrier and Captain Boyson — intervene, urging repentance, reconciliation, or rescue, while legal and social maneuvers determine custody and fate. The story ends in bitter consequences, moral questioning, and an attempted personal atonement that remains ambiguous in its outcome.",

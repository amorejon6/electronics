    "dct:description": "A political and social bildungsroman following Henry (Harry) Coningsby from boyhood at Eton through Cambridge and into public life amid the convulsions around the Reform Act. The novel tracks his upbringing under Lord Monmouth and the manager Rigby, his friendship with schoolfellows, his love for Edith Millbank, and his moral struggle over family loyalty, ambition and principle. Inheritance disputes, party manoeuvres (Tory/Whig), electioneering and parliamentary life drive the plot, while salons and country houses stage social satire and character study. Ultimately Coningsby rejects easy patronage, endures personal loss, marries Edith and seeks a career of public responsibility.",

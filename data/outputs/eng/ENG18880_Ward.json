    "dct:description": "Robert Elsmere, an Oxford-educated clergyman, experiences a prolonged crisis of faith that leads him to resign his living and pursue social and intellectual work. His wavering beliefs strain his marriage to Catherine, whose devoutness and self-sacrifice anchor the household even as Rose Leyburn's artistic ambitions and romantic entanglements create secondary tensions. Elsmere founds a reforming Brotherhood and devotes himself to urban ministry and public debate about miracles, conscience, and religious reconstruction. The novel moves between rural parishes and cosmopolitan settings, tracing illness, death, social reform, and the personal costs of moral honesty in late-Victorian society.",

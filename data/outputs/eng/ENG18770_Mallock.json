    "dct:description": "A gathering of educated friends assemble at Otho Laurence’s classical seaside villa for a series of planned conversations about the Aim of Life, Town and Country, Art, Religion and the Future. The chapters dramatise extended debates among characters who represent competing positions — devotion, sceptical science, cultivated æstheticism, social reform and cynical progress — while social manners, love, and personal histories provide intimate counterpoints. The novel satirises and examines late-Victorian intellectual life and social pretensions through dialogue, toying with the costs of unbelief, the consolations of faith, and the value of culture. Interwoven are small personal dramas (deaths, loves, confessions) that underline wider ideological conflicts.",

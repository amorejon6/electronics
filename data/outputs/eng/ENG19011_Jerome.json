    "dct:description": "A series of linked comic anecdotes told by Henry, a worldly waiter, recording episodes from his life among customers in London and abroad. The stories recount encounters with colourful figures — a red-haired music-hall star who marries into the aristocracy, a would-be burglar turned missionary, a frantic father who mistakes a dog for his baby, and couples humbled and reshaped by fortune. Jerome uses Henry’s observant, ironic voice to examine class mobility, romance, vanity and the small hypocrisies of polite society. The tone is humorous and satirical, mixing warm sympathy for working people with wry social commentary.",

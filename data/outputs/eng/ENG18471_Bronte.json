Heathcliff, an adopted foundling, returns wealthy and wreaks long, cruel vengeance on the Earnshaw and Linton families while remaining tormented by his lost love, Catherine. The novel traces how familial rivalries, social class, and violent temperaments destroy and reshape two generations, with the wild moorland a constant, hostile presence. Amid Gothic atmosphere and domestic brutality, a later generation (notably Hareton and young Cathy) hints at possible reconciliation and renewal.",

    "dct:description": "A genteel but impecunious English family, the Polkingtons, struggle with pride, debt and social pretence. The middle daughter Julia travels to Holland to earn a living, becomes entwined with a Dutch bulb-grower family and with an English gentleman, Rawson-Clew, while confronting questions of honour, theft and loyalty. A prized blue daffodil and a stolen chemical secret (an explosive) drive a series of moral tests: theft, repayment of debts, and personal sacrifice. In the end debts are settled in unexpected ways and Julia and Rawson-Clew form a partnership that bridges social and moral divides.",

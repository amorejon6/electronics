    "dct:description": "A young Welsh woman, Esther Craven, oscillates between duty, desire and social pressure in a rural Victorian community. Engaged reluctantly to the kindly but poor Robert Brandon, she is drawn into a passionate but troubled attachment with St. John Gerard while coping with the death of her beloved brother Jack. The novel exposes provincial morals, class pressures and the costs of romantic caprice as Esther becomes a companion in an old household and endures illness, shame and final reconciliation. It combines sharp social observation with domestic tragedy and a climax that resolves several moral tensions in marriage and loss.",

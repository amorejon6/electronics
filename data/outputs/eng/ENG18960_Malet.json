    "dct:description": "A first-person narrator recounts the courtship and tragic undoing of Constantine Leversedge and Charlotte Perry at a Lake Geneva hotel in the fin-de-siècle. Leversedge, a prosperous but haunted returned colonial, is tormented by a recurring, materialising vision of a mangy dog born of a South African atrocity; Charlotte, a beautiful and modern young woman, responds with theatrical devotion and later with manipulative stratagems. Social rivals and opportunists (notably the journalist Percy Gerrard) intrude, a dramatic confrontation exposes deception and fear, and Leversedge dies soon after under ambiguous circumstances. The story mixes social comedy and satire of manners with psychological supernatural dread culminating in a personal catastrophe.",

She is complex and strategic—capable of devoted care and theatrical displays of sacrifice yet also of manipulation and performance to secure social and personal ends, and her choices are central to the moral and tragic tensions of the plot."

    "dct:description": "A satirical social novel that follows the life of an unnamed infant—\"Ginx's Baby\"—abandoned by his overburdened parents in Victorian London and successively claimed by a convent, Protestant committees, rival parishes, clubs, and political bodies. Through episodic episodes the child becomes a contested symbol of sectarian zeal, charitable mismanagement, bureaucratic indifference, and political posturing. The narrative exposes the failures of charity, the Poor Law, religious factionalism, and superficial reformers while tracking the child's physical decline and ultimate tragic end. The book interrogates how institutions and public opinion mistreat vulnerable individuals even as they profess concern for them.",

He functions as an emblem of social failure: repeatedly rescued and exploited by institutions, his physical decline and eventual death dramatize the novel's critique of public hypocrisy and inadequate social provision."

She represents institutional charity mingled with doctrinal ambition; her measures and conflicts with Protestants dramatize sectarian competition for moral authority over vulnerable lives."

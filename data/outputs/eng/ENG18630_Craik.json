    "dct:description": "A domestic realist novel set in mid‑19th‑century England following the lives of the three Misses Leaf — gentle, long‑suffering Johanna, fretful Selina, and intellectually gifted Hilary — after they take into their household a rough but honest servant, Elizabeth Hand. The book traces household struggles: poverty, the moral failures and flight of their nephew Ascott, Selina's ill‑fated marriage and death, Hilary's self‑sacrifice and eventual marriage to Robert Lyon, and Elizabeth's development from a coarse country girl into a faithful, maternal servant. Themes of duty, social class, female labor, sacrifice, and the redemptive effects of kindness recur as characters confront temptation, debt, and loss. The plot interweaves courtship and moral tests (Hilary and Robert, Elizabeth and Tom Cliffe) against a realistic portrait of provincial and London life.",

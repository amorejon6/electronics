    "dct:description": "A young English‐born nursemaid raised in Italy, Anne Brown, is educated and supported by the poet‑painter Walter Hamlin; their unequal patronage and the collision between æsthetic circles and real social need propel the plot. The novel traces Anne’s moral development as she confronts class prejudice, sexual scandal, philanthropic schemes, and a painful decision about marriage and independence. Against Italian and English backdrops (Villa Arnolfini, Lucca, Florence; London and Wotton Hall), tensions between art, desire, and social responsibility intensify around Hamlin, Anne, Melton Perry, Madame Elaguine and Richard Brown. The book is a psychological social novel exploring aestheticism, class mobility, and the costs of moral compromise.",

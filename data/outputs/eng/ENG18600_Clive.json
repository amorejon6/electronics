    "dct:description": "A convent‐bred young woman, Elinor Ladylift, is introduced to English country life where she attracts the attention of the charismatic Leslie. A jealous hostess, Laura Chanson, engineers deceptions — including a forged billet — that drive a wedge between Leslie and Elinor; Leslie, stricken by fever and despair, marries Laura under fatal misunderstandings. Elinor returns to the convent and Leslie, recovering, broods on betrayal and loss until a destructive resolution is reached. The narrative traces passion, jealousy, social maneuvering and the moral collapse that explains why Leslie ultimately kills his wife.",

He is well‑meaning and paternal but politically and socially inattentive to the darker intrigues around him, enabling Laura’s schemes to proceed with little early scrutiny."

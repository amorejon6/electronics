    "dct:description": "A study of an English woman's relations and the strains of marriage in early twentieth-century society. Marjorie Pope moves between suitors, family pressures and social ambitions, eventually marrying Richard Trafford; both confront conflicts between domestic life and intellectual purpose. Trafford abandons laboratory research for business, later suffers a crisis of meaning and together they retreat to Labrador where hardship forces them to reassess priorities. The novel examines gender roles, class manners, the costs of material comfort and a search for a larger moral and intellectual life.",

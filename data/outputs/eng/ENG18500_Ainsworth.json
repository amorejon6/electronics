    "dct:description": "Auriol Darcy, having drunk an alchemical elixir distilled by his aged kinsman Doctor Lamb, attains apparent immortality but becomes bound to a terrifying compact that demands the surrender of a female victim at intervals. The narrative follows his tormented attempts to resist the diabolic demands—embodied by the sinister Cyprian Rougemont—and to protect his beloved Ebba Thorneycroft, who is abducted into a gothic chamber of ritual and terror. Interwoven with London‑set episodes of street ruffians, dog‑fanciers, and the dwarf Flapdragon/Old Parr, the novel traces occult laboratories, subterranean prisons, and Faustian bargains across centuries. The story blends supernatural horror, moral anguish, and melodramatic rescue attempts against a shadowy conspirator who traffics in occult power and human ruin.",

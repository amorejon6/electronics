    "dct:description": "The Story of a Modern Woman follows Mary Erle, daughter of a celebrated scientist, as she is thrust into independence after her father's death and attempts to make a living as an artist and journalist in late-Victorian London. The novel traces her friendships (notably with Alison Ives), her entanglements with two very different men—Vincent Hemming and Perry Jackson—and the moral crises that confront her when intimacy, ambition, and social expectation collide. Episodes in Whitechapel hospital, the stage, and London drawing-rooms expose class contrasts, sexual double standards and professional pressures on women. Ultimately Mary refuses compromises that would injure other women, burns the relics of a failed passion, and resolves to continue alone and self-reliant in the city.",

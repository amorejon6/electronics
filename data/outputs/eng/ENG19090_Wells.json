    "dct:description": "First-person memoir-novel tracing George Ponderevo's rise from a chemist's apprentice to partner in his uncle Edward Ponderevo's patent-medicine empire (Tono-Bungay), and the subsequent moral, social and financial collapse that follows spectacular success. The book follows George's education, apprenticeships, loves (Marion, Effie, Beatrice), his involvement in advertising, flotations and risky ventures (including the quap expedition), and his experiments in flight. It is at once a social satire on English class, snobbery and finance and a personal account of ambition, desire and disillusion. The narrative ends with the ruin of the Ponderevo fortunes and the narrator's reflections on technology, society and the costs of modern commerce.",

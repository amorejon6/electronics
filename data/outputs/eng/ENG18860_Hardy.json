    "dct:description": "Michael Henchard, a hay-trusser, in a drunken fit once sells his wife at Weydon Fair and spends years repenting the consequences. He rises to prominence in the market town of Casterbridge but his past returns when his former wife and her daughter reappear, triggering jealousy, moral conflict, and social humiliation. Elizabeth-Jane, raised ignorant of her true parentage, becomes the center of competing loyalties between Henchard and the young manager Donald Farfrae. The novel follows ruined pride, chance and the harsh social judgments of rural Wessex as personal errors produce tragic outcomes.",

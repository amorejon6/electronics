    "dct:description": "A Victorian scientist invents a machine that travels through Time and uses it to journey far into the future, where he encounters two divergent human-descended species: the frail, childlike Eloi and the subterranean, predatory Morlocks. Stranded when his machine is taken, he lives among the Eloi, forms an attachment to a young Eloi named Weena, and discovers the grim interdependence of the two species. After terrifying excursions into the Morlock underworld and further visions of Earth's deep future, he recovers his machine and returns to his own time to tell his tale. The narrative functions as both an adventure in speculative futurity and a sustained social and evolutionary critique of capitalist division and human decadence.",

Her childlike devotion humanizes the future world and motivates the Traveller's protective impulses, while her eventual fate underscores the novel's tragic critique of decadence.

They are depicted as industrial, inhuman, and adaptive to darkness, representing a reversal of social power and a biological consequence of long-term class division. As collective antagonists they embody the novel's anxieties about exploitation, technological dependence, and evolutionary divergence."

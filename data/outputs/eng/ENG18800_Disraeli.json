    "dct:description": "A young man of promising birth, Endymion Ferrars, grows from privileged boyhood through political exile, civil service and parliamentary life while his twin sister Myra navigates society, ambition and a dramatic personal destiny. The novel follows their families and social circle—ministers, bankers, aristocrats, foreign princes and priests—against the backdrop of early 19th‑century England and continental Europe, tracing political crises, social ambition, religious conflicts and the railway boom. Personal love stories (marriage, sacrifice, rivalries) are entangled with public affairs: reform, Catholic emancipation, and international intrigues. The narrative charts moral choices, the costs of ambition and the shaping effect of friendship and patronage on careers and fates.",

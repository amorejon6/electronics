    "dct:description": "A young seaman rashly leaves his berth and, by a chain of chance and the intervention of port authorities, is unexpectedly appointed captain of a sailing ship in the East. He must take command in the Gulf of Siam and confronts delays, an ailing crew struck by tropical fever, and the unsettling legacy of his predecessor’s mysterious death. Isolated at sea amid calms and capricious winds, he faces moral tests, practical crises and moments of psychological terror that force him to grow into his responsibility. The narrative blends maritime realism with a brooding, sometimes uncanny atmosphere as the narrator crosses the figurative \"shadow-line\" into maturity.",

    "dct:description": "In a small English Midland village, the thrifty old labourer John Bolderfield entrusts the savings of a lifetime to his niece Bessie and her husband Isaac. Bessie, after receiving a small legacy, falls into extravagance, drink and eventually surreptitiously takes large sums from John's box; her husband's son Timothy also steals some of the hoard. Discovery and village suspicion follow, precipitating domestic ruin, public shame and Bessie's fatal suicide by the well. The novel examines the social repercussions of moral failure, the strains of poverty and pride, and the quiet compassion of neighbours like Mary Anne Waller.",

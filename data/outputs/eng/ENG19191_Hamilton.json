Their honeymoon in the Belgian Ardennes is shattered by the outbreak of the First World War: they are captured, William witnesses atrocities and Griselda dies while fleeing. Traumatized and converted from his former pacifist/sectional politics, William attempts to enlist, serves as a soldier and later as a clerical orderly in France. The novel follows his moral and emotional transformation amid war, loss and the grind of military bureaucracy.",

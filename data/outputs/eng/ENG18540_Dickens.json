    "dct:description": "Hard Times follows the lives of inhabitants of the industrial town of Coketown, where Thomas Gradgrind’s doctrine of facts and utility shapes family life and education. The novel charts the harm produced by rigid utilitarian schooling (notably on Louisa and Tom Gradgrind) and contrasts it with the humane, imaginative world represented by Sissy Jupe and the circus. Social injustice and class tensions appear in Stephen Blackpool’s struggles as an exploited worker, complicated by a bank robbery and mistaken suspicions. Interpersonal failures, a secret love affair and moral reckonings lead characters to remorse, practical reconciliations and a critique of industrial Victorian values.",

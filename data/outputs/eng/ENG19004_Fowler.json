    "dct:description": "Set in the industrial Midlands around the Osierfield ironworks, the novel follows Elisabeth Farringdon, an imaginative adopted heiress raised in a strict Methodist household, as she grows into a celebrated artist. Her affections and convictions are tested by several men—faithful, self-sacrificing Christopher Thornley, the skeptical reformer Alan Tremaine, and the charming artist Cecil Farquhar—while questions of duty, religion and social responsibility play out against the ‘‘Black Country’’ backdrop. Christopher undertakes a moral quest to secure the rightful heir of the Farringdons, endures illness and sacrifice, and Elisabeth must face her mistakes and rediscover the priorities of love and service. The story contrasts industrial life, religious debate and artistic ambition, and ends with reconciliations, moral reckonings and renewed commitments to one another and the community.",

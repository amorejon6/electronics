    "dct:description": "The novel follows the intertwined lives of several writers and their families in late-19th-century England, contrasting the commercialised London literary market with provincial life. It traces the collapse of Edwin Reardon's literary career, the resulting separation from his wife Amy, and the social and economic consequences that ripple through two families. Parallel strands follow Marian Yule's dutiful struggle to support her scholarly father and Jasper Milvain's pragmatic rise in the periodical world. The narrative examines artistic integrity versus commerce, marriage and social mobility, and the human costs of poverty and ambition.",

He refuses to compromise his principles, struggles to earn a living through menial work, and his declining health and eventual death form the emotional center of the story."

Her separation from Edwin, the complications of an unexpected inheritance, and her pragmatic choices drive much of the domestic and moral conflict in the novel."

His career-oriented pragmatism and shifting loyalties—vacillating between idealism and practical calculation—contrast sharply with Reardon's artistic idealism and shape several romantic entanglements."

Marian becomes the emotional center of several relationships and embodying quiet self-sacrifice, she is driven from London to provincial employment as the family's misfortunes multiply."

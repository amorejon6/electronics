    "dct:description": "A comic-fantastic satire in which a self-satisfied London merchant, Paul Bultitude, is transformed into his schoolboy son after handling a mysterious Indian talisman. Mistaken for the boy, the middle-aged Paul is packed off to the harsh routines of Crichton House and endures humiliation, bullying and the strict discipline of Dr. Grimstone. Meanwhile his son Dick enjoys the comforts of adult life — until rivalries, lost magic, and family conflicts force a crisis. The story resolves when the talisman is recovered and identities restored, leaving family ties and social pretences amended but not without consequence.",

His youthful selfishness and impulsiveness drive much of the plot (including the misuse and loss of the talisman), yet he is capable of remorse and ultimately helps to restore the family balance."

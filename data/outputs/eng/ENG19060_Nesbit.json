    "dct:description": "Four London children on holiday reencounter a grumpy sand‑fairy, the Psammead, and obtain half of a red amulet that can transport them through time. They travel to many historical and legendary places — prehistoric Britain, ancient Egypt, Babylon, Atlantis, Tyre and Roman camps — seeking the missing half while learning, squabbling, and having adventures. The amulet finally reunites and grants the children their heart’s desire (the return of their parents), while a priest and a scholarly neighbour are mysteriously united through the charm. The Psammead departs for the past, and the children are reunited as their parents return home.",

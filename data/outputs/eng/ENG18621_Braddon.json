    "dct:description": "At Audley Court the handsome and beguiling Lucy Graham becomes Lady Audley by marrying the much older Sir Michael, but she hides a dark past. When George Talboys, a young widower and old acquaintance, disappears after confronting her, his cousin Robert Audley pursues the truth. Robert's investigation unearths deception, staged death and domestic crime, forcing a moral reckoning that leads to Lady Audley's removal to an asylum and to efforts to restore the injured. The novel interweaves sensation, investigation and a critique of marriage, class and reputation in mid‑Victorian England.",

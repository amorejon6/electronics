    "dct:description": "A domestic and social novel that follows the Dodd family of Barkington and the Hardie family as love, honour and money collide in Victorian England. Julia Dodd's attachment to Alfred Hardie is tested by class, parental caution and a banking fraud that destroys livelihoods and triggers public scandal. Parallel maritime episodes follow Captain David Dodd through piracy, storm, wreck and the perilous fate of the family's savings, while Alfred is wrongfully confined in private asylums and must struggle for his liberty and reputation. The narrative culminates in public legal redress, recovered identities and reconciliations, offering sustained critique of financial crime, lunacy law and institutional abuse alongside romantic and familial drama.",

She grows to womanhood, meets the wood-woman Habundia who teaches her lore, and escapes a series of supernatural and human threats while travelling among enchanted isles. She aids three knights (the Quest) to recover their loves and is herself reunited with a true love, Arthur the Black Squire. The tale follows her coming-of-age, a quest-like series of island adventures, confrontations with witchcraft, and finally a return to settle in a community at Utterhay.",

    "dct:description": "A personified Slander narrates how a small piece of gossip in a provincial English town grows into a destructive falsehood. The story follows Sigismund Zaluski, a Polish merchant loved by Gertrude Morley, who is wrongly accused of being a Nihilist and implicated in the assassination of the Czar. The rumour spreads through drawing-rooms, letters and a novelist’s notes to St. Petersburg, where Zaluski is arrested, imprisoned and dies. The novel is a moral and social critique of thoughtless gossip, responsibility and the consequences of social prejudice.",

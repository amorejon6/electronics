    "dct:description": "A moral domestic tragedy set in Victorian England tracing the ruin that follows an unlawful marriage between a man and his deceased wife’s sister. The story follows two orphaned sisters, Elizabeth and Agnes Maynard: Elizabeth’s jealous fears about her husband Richard’s affection for Agnes culminate in her death, and Agnes later marries Richard. The clandestine marriage brings social ostracism, family disintegration and multiple deaths, while the surviving daughter Mary is left mentally ruined. The novel functions as a didactic critique of selfishness, lax moral reasoning, and the social and spiritual consequences of transgressing moral and religious law.",

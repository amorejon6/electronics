    "dct:description": "Set in a late‑Victorian Cornish fishing community, the novel follows young Joan Tregenza who becomes the model and obsession of the artist John Barron. Barron's passionate painting of Joan—framed by gorse and sea—awakens love, artistic sacrifice and social conflict: Joan's engagement, her step‑father's rigid Luke Gospeler faith, and the jealousy of Joe Noy converge in tragedy. Secrets, a thousand‑pound gift, and competing creeds culminate in drowning, madness and revenge, while the novel continually contrasts Nature, art and narrow religious moralism. The ending leaves ruined lives, a dead artist and a community struggling with loss and consequence.",

Obsessed with truth in art, he sacrifices health and convention to his work, pursues Joan respectfully then possessively, and his actions trigger jealousies and moral crises that lead to his own tragic, early death."

Simple, fatalistic and driven by a Luke Gospeler sense of desert and duty, he pursues the man he blames for Joan's ruin—an arc that exposes the novel's themes of justice, revenge and the limits of human agency."

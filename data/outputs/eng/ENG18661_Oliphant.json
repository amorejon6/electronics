    "dct:description": "Miss Marjoribanks follows Lucilla Marjoribanks as she returns to her widowed father's house in the provincial town of Carlingford and sets out to reorganise its social life through carefully managed \"Evenings\" and musical salons. The novel traces her tactics as she cultivates singers and guests, navigates domestic power, and negotiates rivalries and suitors amid local gossip, imposture, and a contested parliamentary election. A sudden death and financial collapse force Lucilla to confront practical burdens and moral responsibility, even as she pursues philanthropic plans and social improvement for the town. The narrative balances observant irony and social comedy while emphasising female agency, marriage, and small‑town opinion in mid‑Victorian England.",

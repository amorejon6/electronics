    "dct:description": "A proud and emotionally reserved young woman, Belinda Churchill, lives with her grandmother and flirtatious sister Sarah while their lives move between Dresden and Oxbridge. Belinda is courted by the young idealistic David Rivers but, following a series of misunderstandings and family pressures, she marries the older, pedantic Professor Forth to secure a respectable home. The novel follows the consequences of that marriage: Belinda's inner conflict between duty and desire, Rivers' return and continuing devotion, social gossip, jealousy, and moral strain among a circle of English and continental characters. Tensions culminate in crises of conscience, public exposure and tragic consequences that force each character to face the cost of their choices.",

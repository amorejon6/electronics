    "dct:description": "A first-person account of Joshua Davidson, a Cornish carpenter whose sincere Christian faith evolves into a program of social reform and Christian Communism. Leaving Cornwall for London, he ministers to the poor, rescues and protects outcasts, and organises labour while struggling with religious doubt and institutional hostility. He joins international labour movements and participates in the Paris Commune, witnessing the Commune's hopes and brutal suppression. The book traces his moral courage, practical charity, political activism, and eventual martyrdom at a public meeting.",

    "dct:description": "A socially engaged novel set in a rural English county that follows Lancelot Smith, a cultivated but restless young man whose romance with Argemone Lavington prompts a moral and social awakening. The narrative interleaves scenes of country sport and drawing-room debate with sustained examination of rural poverty, housing, public health, and the responsibilities of landlords and clergy. Religious controversy (Oxford movement/Tractarianism, conversions to Rome, Evangelicalism) and arguments about political economy and reform drive tensions between characters. Tragedy and moral testing (deaths, a fatal inquest, Argemone’s illness and death) compel Lancelot and the keeper Tregarva toward active engagement with the poor and toward a search for practical remedies and spiritual direction.",

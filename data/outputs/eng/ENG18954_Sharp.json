    "dct:description": "A West End musician, Digby Raleigh, becomes entangled in a love triangle with the unconventional Lady Joan Relton and the innocent Norah Bisley while navigating family obligations at Murville Manor and the little town of Relton. Misunderstandings, a secret past, and a presumed death (and return) complicate engagements and loyalties, exposing the characters' differing attitudes to marriage, art, and duty. The novel satirises provincial society, fashionable philanthropy, and Bohemian artistic pretensions against a backdrop of late Victorian manners. Ultimately domestic attachments and practical kindness reshape relationships more than ideals or rhetoric.",

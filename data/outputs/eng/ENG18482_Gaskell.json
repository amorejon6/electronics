    "dct:description": "Set in and around industrial Manchester in the 1840s, the novel follows Mary Barton, the working-class daughter of a trade-unionist, as she navigates love, poverty and family tragedy. The story traces class tensions between mill-owners and workers, strikes and the desperate privations of factory families, and the radicalisation of her father John Barton after bereavement. A murder (the killing of a mill-owner's son) leads to a wrongful accusation against Jem Wilson, whose life Mary strives to save by proving an alibi. The book interleaves a social protest about industrial society with intimate portraits of grief, love and moral complexity.",

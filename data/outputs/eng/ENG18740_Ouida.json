    "dct:description": "A foundling named Bébée is raised by an old gardener in the Brabant countryside and makes her living selling flowers in Brussels. She is befriended and tutored by a charismatic painter, Flamen (Victor), who awakens her curiosity and gives her books, but ultimately seduces and abandons her. Driven by love and loyalty she walks to Paris to tend him when news of his illness arrives, only to discover his betrayal; returning broken, she drowns herself. The novel traces innocence exploited by art and urban glamour and critiques social vulnerability in a late 19th-century Belgian setting.",

    "dct:description": "A sweeping Victorian novel centred on the long-running Chancery suit Jarndyce and Jarndyce and its corrosive effects on a wide circle of characters. Through Esther Summerson's intimate first-person narration the book moves between fog-bound London, the court, and the country house Bleak House, exposing legal inertia, social hypocrisy and human suffering. Parallel strands include a murder investigation and the hidden past of Lady Dedlock, whose secret identity and exposure have tragic consequences. Dickens blends social satire, melodrama and detective elements to probe justice, class, illegitimacy and urban poverty in mid-19th-century England.",

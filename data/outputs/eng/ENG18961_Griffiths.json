    "dct:description": "A violent murder is discovered aboard the Rome Express on its run toward Paris, plunging a handful of passengers into an immediate police inquiry. Chief Detective M. Floçon and the instructing judge investigate a web of lies, blackmail and escape involving a beautiful countess, her maid, an Italian detective, and a banker. Clues — a scrap of lace, a laudanum vial, a stolen pocket-book and a lost notebook — gradually reveal motives and identities. The true sequence of events leads to a dramatic identification, arrest and trial, and the novel closes with punishment for the guilty and an unexpected marriage for the countess.",

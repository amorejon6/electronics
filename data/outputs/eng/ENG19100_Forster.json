    "dct:description": "A study of two families whose lives collide around a country house called Howards End: the idealistic, cultured Schlegels and the practical, property-minded Wilcoxes. The story follows sisterly bonds (Margaret and Helen Schlegel), a fraught cross-class encounter with Leonard Bast, and disputes over inheritance, social responsibility and personal connection. Tensions between private affections and public duties escalate to tragedy and legal consequences, forcing characters to confront class, money and moral responsibility. The novel contrasts city and country life and traces attempts to \"only connect\" inner values with the outer world.",

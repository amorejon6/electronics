    "dct:description": "Set on the English uplands near the border with Wales, the novel follows Stephen Fern, a pious, hardworking boy who strives to protect his blind grandfather, sister Martha and little Nan after their family home is taken by the local master. A kindly young woman, Miss Anne, teaches Stephen to read and guides him in Christian duty while social pressure, enclosure and poaching bring conflict and tragedy—most painfully the accidental death of little Nan. Stephen endures temptation to revenge, falls ill, then recovers to forgive his enemies, witnesses the master’s ruin and deathbed repentance, and ultimately sees his home restored and offered a future through his benefactors. The story mixes rural social critique with moral and religious instruction and a coming-of-age arc for its protagonist.",

    "dct:description": "A sprawling mid‑Victorian sensation novel set chiefly in London (with episodes in a fictional Italian duchy, Castelcicala) that intertwines social critique, crime and melodrama. It follows Richard Markham — a principled young gentleman whose life moves between benevolent rescue, wrongful accusation, military adventure and romantic devotion — and interlocks plots of forgery, blackmail, resurrectionist body‑snatching, gambling, and political intrigue. Eliza Sydney (disguised at times and variously convicted and redeemed), Ellen Monroe, and other vulnerable women suffer exploitation and social stigma while villains like George Montague/Greenwood and the Resurrection Man (Anthony Tidkins) engineer fraud, extortion, and violence. The narrative alternates sensational set‑pieces—murders, canal ambushes, daring rescues and revolutionary campaigns—with sustained social criticism of urban poverty, institutional corruption, and class hypocrisy, ending in moral reckonings, punishments for vice, and rewards for virtue.",

    "dct:description": "Dodo follows the vivacious and self-centred Dodo Vane, who marries the wealthy and devoted Lord Chesterford despite not loving him. The novel traces their uneasy married life in late‑Victorian England: Dodo's boredom with domesticity, her friendships and flirtations in London (notably with Jack Broxton), and the tragic death of their infant which intensifies moral conflicts. Jack loves Dodo but resists betraying his friend and cousin; Mrs. Vivian and others attempt to counsel and restrain the parties. The arrival of Prince Waldenech as a pursuing suitor complicates loyalties and exposes the hypocrisies and compromises of high society.",

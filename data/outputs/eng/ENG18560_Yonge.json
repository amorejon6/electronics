    "dct:description": "A mid-19th-century domestic novel about the May family of Market Stoneborough and their moral labours in a provincial English parish. After the death of Mrs May and a carriage accident that injures Dr. May and weakens Margaret, the children—notably Etheldred (Ethel), Margaret, Norman and others—navigate grief, duty, schooling and courtship. Much of the action follows Ethel's energetic efforts to found and sustain the Cocksmoor school and the family's long campaign to build and consecrate a parish church, while Norman wrestles with academic honour, spiritual doubt and a missionary vocation. The narrative emphasises Christian piety, practical charity, education and the patient endurance of domestic trials as means of moral growth.",

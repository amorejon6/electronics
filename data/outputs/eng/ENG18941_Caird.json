    "dct:description": "The Daughters of Danaus follows Hadria Fullerton and her family in a remote Scottish keep and later in England and Paris as they debate fate, female destiny and the cost of artistic ambition. Hadria, a gifted musician, clashes with family duty and social expectations: she briefly pursues music in Paris, marries Hubert Temperley, and becomes entangled with two older male intellectuals whose rivalries expose personal and ethical tensions. The novel examines the pressures that silence or swamp women's talent — family obligation, convention, and economic constraint — and the moral dilemmas that attend personal freedom, love and responsibility. Tragedy and compromise follow: a contested child, the death of a kindly mentor, and Hadria's return to tending her parents while wrestling with loss and conscience.",

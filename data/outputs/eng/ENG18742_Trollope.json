    "dct:description": "A young Queensland squatter, Harry Heathcote, struggles to protect his vast sheep run and homestead at Gangoil from deliberate bushfires and hostile neighbors in the build-up to Christmas. Tensions between squatters and free-selectors, personal pride, and the dangers of the Australian bush drive conflicts that culminate in night-time raids, a pitched bush fight, and an act of bravery. Giles Medlicot, a neighbouring sugar-planter and erstwhile rival, ultimately aids Heathcote and is wounded, leading to reconciliation and a romantic resolution between Medlicot and Kate Daly. The narrative mixes bush-life realism with social conflict and a domestic romantic subplot against the late 19th-century colonial setting.",

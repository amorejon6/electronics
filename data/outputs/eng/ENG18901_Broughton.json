    "dct:description": "A late‑Victorian social novel following James (Jim) Burgoyne, who on return visits to England and later travels to Italy and Algeria becomes entangled with two women: the steady, long‑suffering Amelia Wilson (his fiancée) and the enigmatic Elizabeth Le Marchant. The story traces engagements, misunderstandings, family pressures, a hidden scandal in Elizabeth's past, illness and death (Amelia falls ill and dies), and the emotional consequences for all involved. Much of the action is set in Oxford, Devonshire and Florence, then shifts to Algiers where secrets are confronted and Byng’s impulsive devotion leads to collapse and recovery. Ultimately Burgoyne faces a moral choice and remains to care for Elizabeth after learning the truth of her earlier elopement and its social cost.",

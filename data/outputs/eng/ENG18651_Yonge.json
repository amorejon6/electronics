    "dct:description": "A mid-Victorian domestic and social novel following Rachel Curtis, an energetic reformer who founds a female industrial asylum to relieve lacemakers and takes practical guardianship of her cousin Fanny Temple's children. Her philanthropy is betrayed by an impostor, leading to revelations of systematic cruelty to apprentices, the death of a child, and public scandal that culminates in magistrates' inquiries and assize trials exposing forgery and deceit. The narrative traces intimate domestic responses—remorse, convalescence, investigations, and the reconstitution of families and guardianships—while debating the limits of idealism, duty, and social convention. Parallel plots focus on Ermine Williams, a morally steadfast governess whose quiet courage and self-sacrifice influence those around her, and Colonel Colin Keith, whose legal sense and familial authority help restore order. Through these events the novel examines social reform and philanthropy, gendered expectations about women's work and education, and the tensions between private domestic life and public scandal.",

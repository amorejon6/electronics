    "dct:description": "A witty, satirical account of mid‑Victorian London society narrated by Lord Frank Vanecourt, who records his flirtations, social schemes and moral reflections. Vanecourt becomes entangled in a love triangle around Lady Ursula Newlyte, the scheming Lady Broadhem and his friend Lord Grandon, while intervening in the Broadhem family's financial crisis. The narrative mixes comic social observation, critiques of missionary and ecclesiastical hypocrisy, and episodes of melodrama (fainting, suicide attempt, reconciliations). By the close the domestic complications are largely resolved, moral change is suggested and the narrator prepares to depart for America.",

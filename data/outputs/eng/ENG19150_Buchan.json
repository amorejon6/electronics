    "dct:description": "An ordinary Englishman, Richard Hannay, becomes embroiled in an international spy conspiracy after a frightened American, Franklin P. Scudder, reveals knowledge of a plot and is murdered in Hannay's flat. Hannay flees across the British countryside, adopting disguises and improvising alliances while decoding Scudder's notes to locate a secret escape point used by enemy agents. With the aid of Sir Walter Bullivant and British authorities he uncovers a clandestine network (the 'Black Stone') intent on stealing naval dispositions just before a European war. The novel follows Hannay's resourceful flight, detection of the conspirators, and the prelude to the larger conflict that erupts weeks later.",

    "dct:description": "A first-person narrator, an Armenian émigré and aspiring writer, recounts episodes of London life, love affairs, friendships, and literary soirées in a series of reflective vignettes. Central is his relationship with the beguiling Shelmerdene, whose restless pursuit of experience leads her away from England to the East and alters the narrator's view of his adopted country. The narrative also follows other intimacies — a dissipated liaison with Phyllis, a failed passion for Maurice, and the deep friendship and tragic death of Louis — exposing the costs of passion, restraint, and social performance. Through elegiac reminiscence the book examines identity, social manners, and the tension between appearance and inner life in early twentieth-century society.",

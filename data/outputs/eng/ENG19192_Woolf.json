    "dct:description": "Set in London and its environs, the novel follows Katharine Hilbery — the cultured daughter of a literary family — as she navigates proposals, family duty, and her private passions. A triangle of attachments develops between Katharine, the earnest solicitor Ralph Denham, and the sensitive aspiring writer William Rodney, complicated by Katharine's pragmatic household role and by Mary Datchet’s reforming friendships. Scenes move between drawing-room society, reform meetings, and suburban and country settings, exploring choices about marriage, vocation, and personal freedom. The narrative examines how social rank, family expectations, and individual desire collide in the early twentieth-century urban milieu.",

Engaged to Katharine for a time, he is earnest, neurotic, and easily wounded; his theatrical ambitions and vanity complicate his courtship and friendship ties.

She balances public activism with private affections — especially her complex friendship/feeling for Ralph Denham — and represents a contrasting model of female independence to Katharine’s domestic role. Her office and political work form an important social backdrop."

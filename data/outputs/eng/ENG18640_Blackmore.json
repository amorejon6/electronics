    "dct:description": "Clara Vaughan, who as a child witnessed her father's brutal murder, devotes her life to discovering the killer while coping with poverty and a contested inheritance under the guardianship of her uncle Edgar Vaughan. The narrative follows her investigations in the English countryside and London, her recovery from temporary blindness, and her friendships (notably with Isola) and growing attachment to Conrad. A parallel backstory centred on Edgar's past in the Mediterranean—including a Corsican vendetta and kidnapped children—gradually reveals family secrets and motives. The plot blends detective procedure, Gothic sensation, romance, violent confrontation with the villain Lepardo Della Croce, and a final restoration of heirs and reconciliations.",

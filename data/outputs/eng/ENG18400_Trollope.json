    "dct:description": "The novel follows Michael Armstrong, a poor factory boy whose brave act brings him to the attention of wealthy patrons and exposes the brutality of the apprentice and factory system. Wealthy families stage charitable spectacles while genuine suffering among operatives and their families is revealed, prompting investigations and practical relief efforts led by the heiress Mary Brotherton. Michael endures harsh apprenticeship, escapes, and undertakes a perilous journey before eventual recovery and reunion with his brother, aided by philanthropic intervention. The narrative is a sustained social critique of industrialisation, performative charity, class inequality, and the need for legal and moral reform.",

    "dct:description": "A domestic moral tale about two orphaned siblings, Edward and Ellen Fortescue, taken into the care of their aunt and uncle at Oakwood. The narrative follows the shaping power of parental and domestic influence — contrasting indulgence and disciplined care — as Edward grows into a naval officer and Ellen struggles with timidity, illness and a self-imposed sacrifice to protect her brother. A crisis of secret debt, confession and conscience exposes family tensions and leads to tests of forgiveness, repentance and restoration. The novel emphasises maternal responsibility, moral education of girls, and the redemptive possibilities of home and faith.",

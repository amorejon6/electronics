    "dct:description": "Set in the English midlands around the Reform Bill of 1832, the novel follows the intersecting lives of a newly returned heir, Harold Transome, a principled young radical artisan Felix Holt, and Esther Lyon, the minister's daughter. Political manoeuvring, a disputed inheritance and local electioneering produce social conflict, a riot, a trial and legal intrigue driven by the family lawyer Matthew Jermyn. Esther is revealed to have a legal claim to the Transome estate (as a Bycliffe heir), which complicates loyalties, courtship and the fates of several characters. The story examines class, conscience and the consequences of private and public actions in a provincial community.",

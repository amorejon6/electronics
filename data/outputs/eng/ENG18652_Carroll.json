    "dct:description": "A young girl named Alice follows a White Rabbit down a hole into Wonderland, a dreamlike world governed by absurd logic and talking creatures. She undergoes repeated changes of size, encounters eccentric figures (a Caterpillar, Mad Hatter, March Hare, Cheshire Cat, Queen of Hearts), and witnesses surreal episodes such as a chaotic tea-party and a mock trial. The narrative mixes playful wordplay, parody of adult institutions, and episodic adventures that unsettle ordinary rules of sense. Ultimately Alice awakens, revealing the story as a curiously vivid dream framed by an afternoon on a riverbank.",

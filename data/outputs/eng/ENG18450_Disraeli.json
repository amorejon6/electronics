    "dct:description": "A panoramic social novel about the division between rich and poor in early Victorian England. Through parallel stories — the aristocratic Charles Egremont and the working-class Gerard family, especially Sybil — it exposes industrial poverty, political agitation (Chartism), and attempts at reform. The book alternates scenes in London and a northern manufactural county (Mowbray), showing riots, strike action, parliamentary debate, and private intrigues that manipulate outcomes. It argues for remedying social ills by understanding the people and calls attention to the moral responsibility of the privileged.",

Gerard organizes and inspires the people, suffers imprisonment and persecution, and his fate (and that of his daughter) drives much of the novel’s action and moral urgency."

Morley is both a strategist for reform and a complicated figure morally — advocating moral force and political education while at times engaging in, or being drawn into, secret and ruthless expedients."

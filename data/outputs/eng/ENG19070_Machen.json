    "dct:description": "The novel follows Lucian Taylor, a sensitive and bookish young man raised in a rural parish who becomes obsessed with a nearby Roman fort and the visionary experiences it seems to awaken. He pursues literary ambitions, endures a humiliating theft of his manuscript, and falls into an intense, often eroticized devotion to Annie Morgan while cultivating a private ritualised art. Moving to London to write, he alternates between ecstatic inspiration and crushing desolation, increasingly alienated from ordinary society. The book closes on his isolation and ambiguous death amid hallucinations and the trappings of his strange cult of art and love.",

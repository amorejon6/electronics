    "dct:description": "Two linked narratives contrast a quiet Irish life and a mythic tale. The first follows John Sherman, an indecisive young man from the west of Ireland torn between a comfortable engagement to the fashionable Margaret Leland and his deep, long-standing friendship and love for Mary Carton; social ambition, duty, and regret drive his choices and eventual return to Ballah. The second tale, Dhoya, is a legendary myth of a giant warrior who wins and loses love with a fairy-like woman and is undone by supernatural contests. Together the pieces explore love, identity, social manners, and the pull of landscape and legend.",

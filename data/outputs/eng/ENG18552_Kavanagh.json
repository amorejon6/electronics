    "dct:description": "Rachel Gray is a pious, thoughtful dress-maker living in a poor London suburb whose inner life of prayer and study contrasts with the harshness and smallness of her surroundings. Neglected by her cold father and lightly regarded by neighbours, she devotes herself to humble duties, to a sickly apprentice Mary, and to acts of charity (notably toward the French Madame Rose). The plot follows domestic trials: Richard Jones's struggle to open a grocer's shop, rivalry with a better‑resourced competitor, Mary's illness and death, and Rachel's sacrifices caring for both Jones and her paralyzed father. Through loss, forgiveness (including toward the domineering Mrs. Brown) and quiet endurance Rachel attains a moral consolation and a modest restoration of family ties by the close.",

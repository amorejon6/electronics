    "dct:description": "Set in the fictitious North-Indian town of Eshwara during the British Raj, the novel follows tensions around the opening of a government canal that coincides with a great pilgrimage. Conflicting loyalties among English officers, native soldiers, missionaries and priests escalate into a violent plot to free prisoners and communal unrest. Interwoven is a personal tragedy: a love triangle between Captain Vincent Dering, the singer Laila Bonaventura, and the native officer Roshan Khân culminates in betrayal, a fatal shooting and moral reckonings. The narrative examines colonial power, religious ritual, and the human costs of passion and misunderstanding.",

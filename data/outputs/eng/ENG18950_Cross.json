    "dct:description": "A late-19th-century romantic drama about a young British officer who falls passionately in love with Eurydice Williamson, a beautiful, intellectual woman he meets on an eastern voyage. Their intense mutual attraction is checked when he discovers she is married; Eurydice, convinced that marriage is a sacred obligation despite her husband's indifference, refuses divorce or an affair. The narrative follows the man's struggle with desire, conscience, and self-restraint as he pursues a chaste friendship meant to reform him, while Eurydice upholds duty and moral principle. The plot culminates in the husband's unexpected return, underscoring themes of sacrifice, honor, and social convention.",

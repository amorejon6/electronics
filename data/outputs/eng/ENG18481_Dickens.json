    "dct:description": "A portrait of Mr. Dombey, a proud Victorian merchant whose life and ambitions centre on producing a male heir, and the domestic consequences of that obsession. After the death of his wife the household reorganises around the frail young Paul and the neglected daughter Florence, and the child's prolonged illness and death precipitate quiet grief and familial tension. Manager Carker's discreet manoeuvrings and Mr. Dombey's strategic remarriage to Edith exacerbate social ambition, manipulation and domestic fracture, leading to public humiliation and Florence's flight. The narrative follows rupture and eventual moral reckoning: Walter's return, the exposure of scandals and Carker's treachery, the ruin of the firm and Mr. Dombey's remorse culminate in modest domestic restoration centred on Florence and forgiveness.",

His rigid pride and preoccupation with social standing estrange his daughter and govern domestic relations, driving the central conflicts. Over the course of the story he endures financial and personal ruin and ultimately faces remorse and a modest moral reconciliation."

Neglected by her father and subjected to social coldness, she endures humiliation, finds refuge among loyal friends, and fosters reconciliation through patience and forgiveness. Her constancy elicits protection and eventual domestic restoration."

    "dct:description": "A domestic novel of manners chiefly set in and around Edinburgh and parts of England, following Marion Dunbar as she navigates family distress, social flirtations, and moral trials. The plot interweaves romantic attachments (notably Richard Granville and Captain De Crespigny), a mysterious murder and attempted poisoning, and the rescue and adoption of the foundling Henry De Lancey. A madman’s revelations restore Henry’s true birthright while exposing past crimes, and Sir Arthur Dunbar’s declining health and death intensify the household’s moral reckonings. The narrative balances social satire, evangelical moral reflection, suspense, and reconciliations that restore social order and domestic consolation.",

    "dct:description": "Set mainly in mid‑19th‑century Europe, the novel follows intersecting lives in Parisian salons, the press, and revolutionary clubs as personal dramas collide with national politics. A young, impoverished noble, Alain de Rochebriant, struggles to preserve his ancestral estate amid finance, speculation and the rise of a capitalist elite, while the Englishman Graham Vane undertakes a discreet investigation into the vanished Louise Duval and a contested inheritance. At the center is Isaura Cicogna, a gifted Italian singer and authoress torn between artistic ambition, private devotion and competing suitors; Victor de Mauleon operates behind the scenes in journalism and secret politics. Financial manoeuvres, conspiracies and the outbreak of the Franco‑Prussian War and the Siege of Paris expose class tensions, questions of identity and the moral costs of public life.",

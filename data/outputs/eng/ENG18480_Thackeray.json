    "dct:description": "A sweeping social panorama and satire set in early 19th-century England that follows the intersecting lives of the ambitious Rebecca (Becky) Sharp and the gentle Amelia Sedley (Mrs. George Osborne). Becky uses wit, charm and calculated opportunism to climb provincial and metropolitan society, while Amelia endures love, family ruin, widowhood and devotion to her son. The narrative follows friendships, duels, debts, scandals and the Napoleonic campaigns (including Waterloo), contrasting private affections and domestic suffering with public spectacle and social hypocrisy. Major Dobbin’s steadfast honour and the fortunes of various families expose the transactional, vain and morally ambiguous nature of polite society across England and Continental Europe.",

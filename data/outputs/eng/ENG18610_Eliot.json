    "dct:description": "Silas Marner, a linen-weaver, is falsely accused and exiled, retreats into solitary work in the rural village of Raveloe and devotes himself to hoarding gold. After his hoard is stolen, his life is transformed when an abandoned child, Eppie, wanders into his cottage and gradually restores his capacity for love and social belonging. The narrative follows Silas's moral and emotional rehabilitation, the texture of village life and superstition, and the long-buried secrets of the Cass family, especially Godfrey Cass's concealed marriage and paternity. In the end Eppie chooses to remain with Silas, affirming themes of parenthood, redemption, and community ties.",

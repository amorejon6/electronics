    "dct:description": "The Warden follows Rev. Septimus Harding, the gentle precentor and warden of Hiram's Hospital in the cathedral city of Barchester, who is publicly accused of profiting from an almshouse endowment. A young reformer, John Bold, investigates the charity's accounts, provoking a clash between reform, church patronage, and personal conscience; Harding, torn between duty, reputation, and probity, ultimately resigns. Eleanor Harding, caught between filial loyalty and love for Bold, intervenes to spare her father, and later marries Bold. The novel traces the social and moral consequences of the dispute for the hospital, its inmates, and the cathedral community.",

    "dct:description": "The novel traces intertwined lives in the fictional provincial town of Middlemarch, following courtships, marriages, debts, and local politics. It centres on Dorothea Brooke, whose idealism leads to an ill-fated marriage and later difficult choices of conscience and love, and on Tertius Lydgate, an ambitious physician whose professional aims are undermined by debt and domestic strain. Parallel threads include Will Ladislaw's political engagement and guarded affection, the menace of scandal around Nicholas Bulstrode, and disputes over inheritance and reputation. Through psychological realism and broad social observation the narrative examines marriage, social class, public honour, and the limits of reform in early nineteenth‑century provincial England.",

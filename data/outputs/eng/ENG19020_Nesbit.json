    "dct:description": "A newly married couple, Len and Chloe, leave their cramped London ‘Bandbox’ for an inherited, rambling country manor called the Red House. Their idealism collides with practical chaos—leaky roofs, unsuitable servants, awkward tenants—and a steady stream of comic domestic disasters. Their friend Yolande acts as a resourceful agent and catalyst, reorganizing household affairs while a mysterious ‘ghost’ finishes Len's stories and interferes with authorship, provoking jealousy and comic moral questions. Through mishaps, neighbours, and affectionate everyday detail the novel treats marriage, work and the making of a home with warm humour and social observation.",

    "dct:description": "Set in the turbulent Roman world of the 1st century AD, the novel follows Domitia Longina, daughter of the general Corbulo, through bereavement, abduction and reluctant elevation to imperial status. After Corbulo's enforced suicide Domitia is driven by grief and desire for vengeance, becomes entangled in palace intrigue and is carried off to be the wife of Domitian. The narrative traces private passions (love, hatred, filial devotion) against the public backdrop of the Year of the Four Emperors and the rise of the Flavian dynasty, with scenes in Cenchræa, Gabii, Albanum and Rome. Interwoven is the emergence of an alternative moral and spiritual refuge in early Christian belief, which finally offers Domitia consolation and a new horizon of hope.",

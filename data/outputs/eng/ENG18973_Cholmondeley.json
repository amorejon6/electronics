    "dct:description": "A Devotee follows Sibyl Carruthers, a fragile young heiress whose passionate attachment to the much older Mr. Loftus leads to a controversial marriage. Misunderstanding, gossip and Sibyl's own sensitivity produce jealousy and illness that strain the household, while Mr. Loftus struggles with age, duty, and impending mortality. After a crisis in which he dies as Sibyl tends him, she spends a period of mourning and ultimately marries Doll, the steady cousin who had loved her. The novel examines affection, self-deception and the social pressures surrounding marriage and the declining country estate.",

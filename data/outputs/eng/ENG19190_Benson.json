    "dct:description": "A whimsical, satirical novel set in wartime England in which a young social worker, Sarah Brown, is drawn into the orbit of a spirited witch (who calls herself Angela or Miss Watkins) and a circle of committee ladies, a mild wizard Richard Higgins, and other odd inhabitants of Mitten Island. The book juxtaposes everyday municipal life — committees, charity work, class anxieties — with recurring magical events: broomstick flights, spells, and a small household called the House of Living Alone. Wartime realities (air raids, soldiers, public duty) intrude and amplify moral and comic tensions, culminating in the burning and relocation of the House and the dispersal of its inhabitants. The tone mixes satire, tenderness, and fantasy while probing loneliness, charity, and the limits of social usefulness.",

Her decision to shelter and follow the witch leads her out of office life into the imaginative, communal world of Mitten Island and the Parish of Faery."

            "name": "The Witch / Angela (Thelma Bennett Watkins)",
            "profile": "A free-spirited, naive but powerful magic-worker who manages the House of Living Alone; she is irreverent, affectionate, and the catalyst for most supernatural episodes. She embodies anti‑conventional values, resists domestic conventions and legal authority, and ultimately chooses the solitary, itinerant life of a magic dweller."

            "name": "Richard (Rrchud) Higgins",
            "profile": "A mild, introspective young wizard and the son of Lady Arabel Higgins; he displays gentle occult power, owns Higgins Farm, and serves as a bridge between the magical and social worlds. He is romantic, absent-minded, and drawn to idealized love, offering Sarah a brief, tender companionship and practical help with magic when needed."

Her storylines bring emotional grounding and rural, communal life into the novel's fantastical frame."

    "dct:description": "An Oxford-educated heir inherits an ancient family library and discovers a mysterious mirror-door that leads into a series of uncanny otherworlds. Guided by the enigmatic librarian Mr. Raven, he travels through forests, cemeteries and dreamlike landscapes where he encounters the dangerous, beautiful Lilith and her daughter Lona, and learns of a hidden economy of sleep, death and resurrection. The narrator becomes involved with the Little Ones, a childlike community threatened by a tyrannical princess, and is tested in duty, love and self-sacrifice. The novel is a metaphysical fantasy and allegory about identity, repentance, and the possibility of spiritual rebirth.",

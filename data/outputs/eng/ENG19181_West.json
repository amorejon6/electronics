    "dct:description": "A shell-shocked English officer, Captain Christopher Baldry, returns from World War I with a memory loss that regresses him to the time of his first love. His amnesia splits the household: his wife Kitty feels humiliated and jealous, while his cousin-narrator Jenny observes and mediates. Margaret Allington, the working-class woman from his youth, becomes the focus of his renewed affection and faces the moral choice of restoring his memory or preserving his present happiness. The novel examines the personal and social consequences of war trauma within an English country-house setting.",

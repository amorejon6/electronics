    "dct:description": "A first-person autobiographical novel in which a struggling London clerk recounts his work as a parliamentary reporter, his friendship with the idealistic reformer M’Kay, and their attempts to minister to the urban poor in Drury Lane. The narrator reflects on political scepticism, religious doubt and consolation, and the limits of practical charity while sketching the lives of several destitute or distressed acquaintances. He reunites and marries Ellen Butts, whose devout patience and later illness and recovery shape the narrator’s domestic life and moral outlook. The book moves between social observation, spiritual meditation, and intimate scenes of love, care, and daily hardship in late Victorian England.",

    "dct:description": "A public-school boy, Pocket (Tony) Upton, runs away to London and becomes involved with Dr. Otto Baumgartner, an eccentric photographer who pursues psychic spirit-photography. After a night in Hyde Park Pocket awakens to find a man shot and, believing he fired in his sleep, is hidden and counseled by Baumgartner. An inquiry by the resourceful Eugene Thrush and the discovery of a camera rigged to fire a pistol reveal a pattern of deaths connected to Baumgartner's experiments. Pocket and Baumgartner's niece Phillida confront the moral consequences and ultimately take drastic steps to conceal the lethal photographic device, while themes of guilt, scientific hubris and detection drive the narrative.",
